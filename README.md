## Overview of Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to present data from NYC CitiBike to convince investors to help fund a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines. This bike trip analysis was performed to solidify this proposal to one of the key stakeholders. The raw data was analyzed through Tableau Public in order to produce meaningful visualizations to increase the confidence of the potential stakeholders in the business. CitiBike in NYC has been implemented successfully and Des Moines can use their data to achieve the same outcome. 

## Results - Observe visualizations on Tableau link in Resources Section
Overview of NYC CitiBike Analysis - The total number of rides observed in New York City was **2,344,224**. The majority of the users were annual subscribers versus short-term customers. This could indicate that locals were taking advantage of the bikesharing significantly more than the tourists were. Siginificantly more men than women were observed in the data to be using the CitiBike program. The majority of the starting locations for all the bike rides occurred in Manhattan; concluding to the requirement for the most bikes to be available in the lower Manhattan area as there is the most business in that area. This will also indicate that the bikes located in those areas will need the most maintenance in the long run. 

Longest User Times in the Day - The majority of users were found to be riding bikes for 0-60 mins, with a smaller amount of users riding for longer than 60 mins. The time at which the highest number of users are riding a CitiBike is between 5-7 mins. This indicates that we should ensure bikes are also well stocked within the minimum of 15 minute radius from lower Manhattan, the busiest location for CitiBike users. By gender, males, females and unknown users all share the same trend as indicated above. 

Peak Hours for CitiBike Trips - Throughout the weekdays, Monday to Friday, it is clear that a majority of the rides are occuring in the morning and late afternoon. This can be explained by a typical 8 hour work day; more people are commuting in the morning to work and in the late afternoon to go home after work in comparison to mid-day. On the weekend, Saturday and Sunday, the data shows an even distribution of bike riders throughout the day. The peak hours observed for August are 5PM, 6PM, and 8AM, which is congruent with the Trips by Weekday per Hour data. 

CitiBike Trips by Gender and User Type -  This data further supports the previous observations. Males users are significantly more active on CitiBikes than women are. As an aggregate of data, the weekdays observe more users than the weekends. Additionally, the trips separated by gender indicate a similar trend in CitiBike use throughout the day for weekdays (i.e. morning and late afternoon), and weekends (i.e. spread evenly throughout the day). 

## Summary 
In conclusion, all of these findings can be used to the advantage of Des Moines as the bikesharing program is implemented. The program will have the most users on weekdays between 5-7PM and at 7-9AM as the population is commuting to and from work. The majority of users will be in densely populated areas like downtown. During these times, the bikes should be well stocked for easy access by the customers while maintenance can be performed during low usage times (e.g. 2-5AM). 

Additional visualizations for future analysis would be to specify the exact start and end station names. This can pinpoint which stations were most popular and therefore need more bikes stocked and available for users. The station latitude and longitude should also be taken into consideration and observe if they are congruent with the top starting and top ending locations for the riders. We can also observe if gender or user types have any type of trend in terms of which stations we observe the most trips starting and ending at.
